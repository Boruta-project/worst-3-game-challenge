## 🤔 What is this?

A retro, neon, deliberately terrible ASCII arcade platform containing three
fully playable mini-games. The goal is *not* to be good. The goal is to be
gloriously, artistically, hilariously bad.

Every design decision was made to maximise frustration: clashing colours that
could strip paint, popup ads that fight back, random control reversals, a
score counter that occasionally lies, and a player-name form that rejects vowels
on principle.

And yet — somehow — it works.

## 🏆 Origin story

### The Kilo League

This project is an entry for the **[Kilo League Challenge](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/kilo-league)** —
a year-long competitive arena for AI engineering where developers master the art
of orchestrating intelligent agents rather than just writing code.

The League structure:

| Stage               | What it is                                              | Prize                            |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 🏃 Weekly Speedruns | Fast challenge rounds, new themes every week            | $1 000+ in credits & rewards     |
| 🧪 Quarterly Majors | Exclusive virtual hackathons for top earners            | TBA                              |
| 🥊 Championship     | End-of-year bracket for season qualifiers               | **$50 000 grand prize package**  |

This project was built for one of those hackathon challenges — specifically the
*"Worst Website Ever"* edition:

> 🔥 *A 48-hour online hackathon where you compete to build the most
> hilariously unusable, delightfully terrible, gloriously broken website
> imaginable.*
>
> *Think: auto-playing music, mystery meat navigation, fonts that shouldn't
> exist, pop-ups inside pop-ups, and UX so bad it becomes art.*

The entire application was built using the
**[KiloCode App Builder](https://kilo.ai/appbuilder)** — without writing a
single line of code by hand at first. Pure vibecoding.

### 💡 What is vibecoding?

Vibecoding means describing what you want in plain language and letting an AI
model turn it into working code. You steer; the model drives. When the model
misunderstands (and it will), you correct the course and go again.

No boilerplate. No setup. Just prompts and vibes.

### 🤖 AI models used

Both models below were **available for free** (no credit card required) inside
KiloCode at the time of development:

| Model                | Made by  | Role in this project                                        |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🟣 **MiniMax M2.5**  | MiniMax  | Primary builder — game loop, maze design, scoreboard        |
| 🔵 **GLM-5 (GLM4)**  | Zhipu AI | Secondary passes — UI polish, bug investigation             |

### 🛠️ App Builder

The [App Builder](https://kilo.ai/appbuilder) is a lightweight, web-based
vibecoding tool: describe what you want, watch the AI build it in real time,
and ship in one click. No local setup required.

- **Chat interface** — plain-language prompts, instant live preview
- **Model selection** — pick any of 500+ models for each session
- **One-click deploy** — production URL in seconds, hosting included
- **Export anytime** — take the code into KiloCode IDE or CLI for deeper work

> 💬 *"Describe what you want to build, and watch AI construct it in real
> time."* — KiloCode App Builder

### 🔌 KiloCode IDE extension

Need the full power tool? The open-source
**[KiloCode plugin](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)** for VS Code
(and other editors) adds AI-assisted modes that go far beyond simple chat:
**Code**, **Architect**, **Debug**, **Ask**, and **Orchestrator** — each
focused on a different part of the development workflow.

## 🕹️ The games

The platform sequences three ASCII-based games. Complete all three to post a
final score to the leaderboard.

### 🟢 1 — Glitch Dodger 3000

Navigate a 20×20 grid. Collect coins (`$`), dodge enemies (`X`). Controls
randomly flip on Level 2+. A duck may eat your progress. No refunds.

### 👻 2 — Pac-Man But Confused

Classic maze dot-collection with ghosts that move on their own initiative.
The score sometimes subtracts instead of adding. The ghosts are also confused
by this.

### 🚀 3 — Space Shooter of Doom

Side-scrolling ASCII space shooter. Destroy asteroids, aliens, and bosses.
Enemy bullets exist. Your bullets sometimes disagree with enemies about
whether they connected.

## 😈 Intentionally bad features *(a non-exhaustive list)*

- 🟩 **Color scheme** — Matrix green background, magenta text, cyan borders,
  yellow warnings. All at once. On every screen.
- 📢 **Popup ads** — Appear mid-game. The close button moves when you click it.
  Sometimes the ad reopens two seconds after closing. *"Ad closes in 3 tries
  (probably)."*
- ⌨️ **Player name rules** — Must be 3–12 characters, contain a number, an
  uppercase letter, a symbol, and absolutely **no vowels**. *"Name not
  chaotic enough."*
- ⚡ **Sabotage events** — Random messages like *"A duck ate your progress!
  Quack!"* with real mechanical effects: score halved, controls reversed,
  level reset.
- 🏆 **Leaderboard** — If the score file is missing or corrupted, a hardcoded
  fallback list appears, headed by `Xx_NoScope_xX` with a score of 999 999.
  The real you never had a chance anyway.
- 💥 **Screen flash** — Every 20 seconds. Because why not.
- 🔆 **Header text** — Blinks at 0.5 Hz. Deal with it.

## ⚙️ How the app works

Everything lives in a single Next.js page component (`src/app/page.tsx`,
~1 500 lines). There is no database.

```
Browser (React 19)
  │
  ├── 🎮 Game state machine  (menu → playing → gameover)
  ├── 🖼️  Three game renderers  (ASCII grids drawn via React elements)
  ├── ⚡ Sabotage engine  (random events on every keypress at Level 2+)
  ├── 📢 Popup ad system  (interval-triggered, deliberately hard to dismiss)
  └── 🗃️  Score API  (/api/scores  →  data/scores.json  →  fallback list)
```

The score API is a Next.js Route Handler (`src/app/api/scores/route.ts`) that
reads and writes a local JSON file. It keeps only the top 10 entries. If
anything goes wrong it returns the fallback list and carries on.

Game state flow:

1. 🔤 Player enters a valid (vowel-free) name → game starts
2. 🟢 Dodger → 👻 Pac-Man → 🚀 Space Shooter, each with 3 levels
3. 📈 Score accumulates across all games
4. 🏁 After Space Shooter level 3, score is saved and Game Over screen appears

## 🔬 Assumptions & design notes

- 🗂️ **One file to rule them all.** The App Builder tends to keep everything in
  `page.tsx`. This is not best practice. It is, however, very funny.
- 🎯 **`currentGame === 'tetris'` controls the Space Shooter.** The third game
  changed from Tetris to a space shooter during development, but the internal
  type was never renamed. A feature, not a bug.
- 📐 **The maze is 32 columns wide.** Except when it isn't — two rows shipped
  33 characters wide, shifting the right border one column to the right.
  Fixing that required counting characters by hand like it was 1994.
- 👾 **Enemy spawn intervals.** The AI put `shooterEnemies` in a `useEffect`
  dependency array, which caused the spawn timer to reset every 150 ms and
  never fire. Enemies only appeared at the start of the game. Human review
  found this; a follow-up prompt fixed it with `useRef`.
- 🤔 **Vibecoding has limits.** The models are excellent at generating large
  amounts of coherent code quickly. They are less reliable at maintaining
  consistency across 1 500 lines in a single file. Human review and targeted
  correction prompts remain necessary — especially for React hooks semantics.
